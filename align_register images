with SIFT (scale invariant feature transform)
check out the z stack of a fingerprint
notice how image shifts as we go through the stack

how does this stack look like if we get a z projection of it?
image - stacks - z project
check max intensity
clearly, the image had shifted during acquisition

let us use an image registration to align local eatures in the image stack,
linear stack alignment with SIFT.
plugins - registration - linear stack alignment with SIFT

the interface of SIFT allows you to input parameters for aligning the image stack,
make sure the active image size is within the minimum and maximum image size indicated in the interface.

we can keep the default numerical values in hte interface.
the images in the stack seem to habe been displaced in the x-y direction, 
so we can try translation as the expected transformation.
check the output you want to generate, then click ok.

a log displays the processing status.
the time required depends on how big the image stack is.

processing is hone, let us chek the aligned stack.

let us get a max projection of the aligned stack, 
image - stack - z project - max intensity
look better after registration.

another case
let us say you have a set of images of the same object acquired at different times or 
by different people.
check if the images align by first converting them into a stack, 
image - stacks - image to stack

the order of images depends on the order of opening!

now let us check the stack, the images are clearly not aligned.

let us try a projection, even if this is not really a z-stack.
i will use minimum intensity ince it would work better with this brightfield image.
it looks like the images were displaced in the x-y and have slight rotational differences.

let us try to align this stack with SIFT.

we will keep everything the same ,but use affine for transformation,
and let us uncheck interpolate.

processing doen, and the aligned stack has been generated.

let us check the minimum intensity projection.

not bad, but the transformation caused the borders of the resulting image to be adjusted so that 
the entire transformed image fits in.

we can fix this by cropping the image stack.
image - crop
now the aligned stack looks better.

can we use SIFT on a time series?
we can get a projection of this stack, even if it is not a z-stack.
max intensity.
while the max projection image is distorted due to image shift over time.

we could also get a temporal color coded xy 2d image of this time series.
iamge - hyperstacks - temporal color code

image drift is obvious.

run the alignment plugin,
plugins - registration - linear stack alignment with SIFT

let us use translation for the transformation,
of course you can always try the other transformation algorithms on your own stacks.

looks good,
now let us color code this aligned stack in time.
iamge - hyperstacks - temporal color code
much better.

#################################################
can we use SIFT on multi-channel stacks?
linear stack alignment with SIFt multichannel,
this plugin is available via PTBIOP update site.

the interface is similar, expect we can choose which channel we want as the registration channel.
the registration is done on a channel of interest, the transformation is applied to all the other channels.
then start the registration process.
this will take a lot longer now.

it is finally done, crop the borders.
