comdet plugin for spot detect and object-based colocalization

goal , count these nanoparticles without thresholding.

this is an RGB image, let us convert it to an 8-bit image.
duplicate the image.

since the spots are darker than the backgound, invert the image.
edit - invert 

now the spots are bright,
background looks hetergeneous, but that is ok.
we can work with this.

simple particle detection, launch the plugin combet.
plugin - combet - detect partcles
https://github.com/ekatrukha/ComDet/wiki/How-to-install-plugin 

the detect paritcles dialog window allows you to specify particles size and 
intensity threshold (pariticle brightness)

checking preview detection allows you to see the particles detected on the active image.

to have good detection, you usually need to play with parameters and see how it goes.
proview detection simplifies this task.

if you do not want to include low-intensity particles, increase intensity threshold.

by default, the plugin looks only for parsticles of a specified size,
if you check include larger particles, bigger particles will be detected as well.
if a large particle includes 2 or more particles, check segment larger particles to split these particles further.

ROIs can be displayed as ovals or rectangles.

choosing all detections in the add to roi manager option will add these detected regions around particles
to the roi manager.

the summary table that will be generated can be reset each time a new detection occurs
or appedned to the existing summary.

result table
x_(px): x coordinate of spot (centroid fitting)
y_(px): y coordinate of spot (centroid fitting)
xMin, yMin, xMax, yMax: coordinates of a rectangle around each spot in pixels
NArea is the thresholded area (multi-stage process of filtering, dilation, erosion operations) of 
each spot in pixls.
integratedInt is the sum of all pixels inside the thresholded spot erea minus the average spot-specific 
background intensity.

results can be saves, copied, summarized, sorted and plotted.
the summary displays the number of particles detected.

the ROI manager lists the spot detected,
ROIs will have names of ind(detection #index in result table)_ch(#channel)_sl(#slice)_fr(#frame).

show these ROIs with or without labels in the original image.

flatten creates an RGB snapshot of the image with embedded overlays.

#########################################################
can spot detection be applied on a specific region of interest?
let us use one of the drawing tools to create an ROI on this image.

remember that you can change how these ROIs are displayed.

detection and colocalization in multi-channel iamges
for colocalization, you need a color composite image containing 2 or more channels.

detection works onn the whole image or on an ROI.
