filter can be used for :
+ noise-reduction;
+ artefact-removal;
+ contrast enhancement;
+ correct uneven illumination.

filter changes pixel values.

linear filter, we convolove an iamge with a kernel.
convolution operator,
examples : 
+ mean 
+ gaussian blur
+ sobel-operator

non-linear filter, also replace pixel value inside as rolling window 
but in a non linear function,
example : 
+ min, max,
+ median, variance,
+ standard deviation.
