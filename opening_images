bioformats files could be opened as diffreent color mode, 
with colorized - open with each channels in a separate plane
with composite (multi-channel) - open as a merged composite image with colorized channels
with default - most in grayscale, color could also be display with merge channel via distributed color for channels

image information is displayed inn the title bar: channels, image size, number of pixels,
bit depth, amount of memory used 

channels tool allow single-channel or multichannels overlay display
the channles tool is a versatile way to view individual channel, a merged image and to change color

hyperstack, is a multidimensional image with multiple channels (c), optical slices (z), frames (t)

use lookup table (LUT) for pseudocolor image display

an RGB image could also be split into red, green and blue image components with split channels
merge channles can be used to merge red, green and / or blue channel images or image stacks.

true color images (produced by color cameras) suh as RGB images of histological stains reflect
genuine colors
image - color - dichromacy will change the coloring in your image to stimulate common forms of 
color blindness.
image - color - color deconvolution implements stain separation.

indexed color ca nbe assigned to each channle via LUT

timeplase images can be assigned color codes via hyperstack - temporal color-code
